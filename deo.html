            <h2>Baidyanath Temple</h2>
            <p>If you ask me, what Deoghar is famous for? I’d say the devotion of millions of devotees for Lord Shiva which makes them visit the Baidyanath Dham often.</p><br>
            <p>-Alongside, it is the most sacred place in Jharkhand and an ancient temple of Baba Baidyanath. </p><br>
            <p>-It is also referred to as Deoghar, believed to be the place where Ravana had carried Lord Shiva on his way to Sri Lanka though he failed to do that due to violation of its non-stop-journey.</p><br>
            <p>-If you love to discover spirituality, culture, and nature, pack your bags and get ready to go.</p><br>

            <p>-The best time to visit Deoghar is a subjective topic as the movement you enter this religious place becomes your best time.</p><br>
            <p>-If intricate design and craftsmanship are the things your eyes are craving to spot. </p><br>
            <p>-The temple is entirely dedicated to the deities of Hindus Radha and Krishna which leads to an environment for meditation and reflection.</p><br>
            <p>-Then, you must consider the impressive architecture of Naulakha Temple, which is also considered to be reminiscent of the famous Ramakrishna Mission in Belur, West Bengal.</p><br>
